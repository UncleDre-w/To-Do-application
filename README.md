# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initiated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Commands

In the project folder, you can execute:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when changes are made.\
You may also spot any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app for production into the `build` directory.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode for the best performance.

The build is optimized and the filenames are hashed.\
Your app is now ready for deployment!

Check out the section on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for further info.


Use "ctrl C" to exit npm

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this action is irreversible. Once you `eject`, there's no going back!**

If you're unhappy with the build tools and configuration choices, you can `eject` anytime. This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control. All commands, except `eject`, will still function, but will now reference the copied scripts, which you can modify. After this, you're on your own.

Using `eject` is optional. The curated feature set suits small to mid-sized deployments, and you shouldn't feel compelled to use it. However, we recognize that customization is necessary for some, so it's available when needed.
